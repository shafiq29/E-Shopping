			<p>E(Electronics)-Shopping Guide. I want people to give a flexible interface to get new updates about launched electronics products and their prices. People in this site will be able to order products, post about their requirements and opinions, login as registered user, chat online about their needs, share their likes and ratings for products.
Registration will support profile picture upload, there will be emoticons available during online chat and auto update of messages. </p>
